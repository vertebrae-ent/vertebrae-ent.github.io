[To root](../../README.md)

This folder contains the root component for the app. Its job is to orchestrate the routes, load the configurations and generally start off the show. It does not contain much logic.

If you are looking for code for a specific route, please look under [./views](./views/README.md).
If you are looking for code for generic reusable components, please look under [./shared](./shared/README.md).
