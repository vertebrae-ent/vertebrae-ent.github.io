Listen- building a website is hard, and a lot of the online resources use language that doesnt make any sense!!
I am an amateur, i barely know what a keyboard is, but by god i finally did it- thank you Jekyll, i wish you told me
you were intended for linux two hours ago!

Anyway, hello and welcome to the Vertebrae Entertainment website, or whats gonna eventually turn into that! 
This is going to be more of a static website, and we'll still use Tumblr as a devblog because it'll save
my dumb ass so much time. I have a million assets to draw, i dont have multiple hours a day trying to make sense of
github lingo!!! 

If you by any chance manage to find this site at this stage, thats extremely cool, thanks for being a superfan!
Stay tuned while i try to make sense of this, yeah? :3

Much love, 
Hauk
